    <h1>Diffence.CH Security Policy</h1>
    <p>At Diffence.CH, we prioritize the security and privacy of our users and systems. We appreciate and encourage the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities by security researchers and the wider community. This policy outlines our approach to receiving, handling, and addressing security issues.</p>

    <h2>Reporting a Vulnerability</h2>
    <p>If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in our website or services, please follow the steps outlined below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact us:</strong> Send your report to <a href="mailto:security@diffence.ch">security@diffence.ch</a>. We encourage you to encrypt your message using our <a href="https://diffence.ch/pgp-key.txt">PGP key</a> for secure communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Include details:</strong> Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the steps required to reproduce it, the potential impact, and any relevant screenshots or logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid disclosure:</strong> Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to investigate and address it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>The following areas are in scope for vulnerability testing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All services and subdomains under diffence.ch</li>
        <li>Diffence.CH-owned infrastructure and applications</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Out of scope:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Denial of service attacks (DoS/DDoS)</li>
        <li>Social engineering or phishing attacks against our staff or users</li>
        <li>Physical security of our offices or data centers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are unsure whether a target is in scope, please contact us for clarification before conducting any tests.</p>

    <h2>Safe Harbor</h2>
    <p>We are committed to working with security researchers who discover vulnerabilities. To encourage responsible reporting, we offer a safe harbor for researchers, which means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No legal action:</strong> We will not pursue legal action against researchers who identify and report vulnerabilities in accordance with this policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> We will work with you to understand the issue, implement a fix, and coordinate any public disclosures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To qualify for safe harbor, you must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption of services.</li>
        <li>Use the identified communication channels to report the vulnerability.</li>
        <li>Allow us sufficient time to resolve the issue before making any public disclosure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and will acknowledge your contribution on our <a href="https://diffence.ch/security/acknowledgements">Acknowledgements page</a> if your report leads to a significant fix. If you prefer to remain anonymous, please let us know in your submission.</p>

    <h2>Response Process</h2>
    <p>When you report a vulnerability, here's what you can expect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Our security team will assess the vulnerability and determine its impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> We will work to fix the issue as quickly as possible and may reach out for further information if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Once the issue has been resolved, we may work with you to coordinate a public disclosure if appropriate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this security policy periodically. Significant changes will be communicated on our website and to researchers who have previously submitted reports.</p>
